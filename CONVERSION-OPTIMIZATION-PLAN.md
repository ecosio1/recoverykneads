# 🎯 Recovery Kneads Conversion Optimization Strategy

## Executive Summary
Transform the website from informational to conversion-focused, with the singular goal of driving appointment bookings through strategic UX improvements, trust signals, and reduced friction.

## 📊 Current Conversion Issues Identified

### Critical Issues
1. **Broken CTAs**: Main hero CTAs link to empty #scheduler instead of Square booking
2. **No Phone Visibility**: Phone number buried in footer (major trust/conversion issue)
3. **Pricing Hidden**: No pricing visible until deep in pages (creates friction)
4. **No Urgency**: No scarcity or time-sensitive elements
5. **Weak Trust Signals**: "Licensed" mentioned but not prominent
6. **Navigation Dilution**: Blog/About dilute focus from booking

### Missed Opportunities
- No sticky header with booking CTA
- No "Book in 30 seconds" messaging
- No same-day availability mentions
- No limited spots messaging
- No clear 3-step booking process
- No objection handling (FAQ above fold)

    <a href="[SQUARE_URL]" class="mini-book">Book Now →</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Hero Section Rewrite
```
